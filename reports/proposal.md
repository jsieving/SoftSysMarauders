## Ashley Swanson, Jane Sieving, Emma Pan (The Marauders)

Project 2 for Software Systems Spring 2019 @ Olin College.


### The Goal

The goal of this project is to create a Marauder’s Map application. The program would allow users to log into a network and track and report their whereabouts using proximity to wifi routers throughout Olin’s campus. As a minimum viable product, we hope to create an application which can report the location of a single user in a text-based format within the terminal. Our stretch goals include tracking multiple users at once and visualizing the output graphically. 


### Learning Goals

We hope to learn about networks, how to work with them in C, and how to obtain useful, physical information from the WiFi networks Olin has in place. We are also likely to learn about the process of implementing a project we initially know very little about. Lastly, we hope to learn about creating well-organized, reader-friendly code. We are lumpers, but we will try to be chunkers in this project.


### Getting Started

The most crucial step we should take before we can dive in is to discuss whether this project is feasible, with the way that the Olin wifi network is set up. We will speak to Mike in IT about this as soon as possible. If this project is feasible, we will be looking for information resources, and places we can go for help. The Olin Marauder’s Map has existed before on an outdated wifi network, and the repo can be found here: https://github.com/olin/maraudersmap-2010/tree/master/map 

- Email Mike to set up a meeting
- Meet with Mike, learn how Olin’s wifi network works, and determine whether this project would work given the network setup.
- Clone and familiarize ourselves with the repo for the project by which this was inspired
- Look for resources on networks and router tracking in C
- Read Networks chapter in HFC
